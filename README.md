# How to install
This bash script has been tested in elementary os

1. Download the script files to your home folder.
2. Using terminal navigate into the directory.
3. make the **"installer.sh"** executable
```bash
chmod +x installer.sh
```

4. Run the installer file

That will create a destop entry for wireless adb.

When you run adb it prompt for ip address then it will connect to phone wirelessly.
